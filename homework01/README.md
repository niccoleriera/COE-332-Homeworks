In this "homework01" directory, I have 3 things. I have two python scripts--one called prime.py and the other even_or_odd.py. prime.py loops through numbers from 3-100 and finds all of the prime numbers. even_or_odd.py looks at every integer in a list of 10 integers and determines if each is even or odd. The last file I have is this README.md file which is meant to describe what the contents of my homework01 directory are.
